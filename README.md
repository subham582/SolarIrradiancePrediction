Solar Radiation Prediction using Meteorological Data


Project Overview
This project aims to predict solar radiation using meteorological data collected from the HI-SEAS weather station over four months (September through December 2016). Solar radiation is a critical measure of how much energy the sun sends to Earth, and understanding it is essential for various applications, including optimizing solar panel installations.

Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project includes the following fields:

Row Number: Useful for sorting the data.
UNIX Time: Seconds since January 1, 1970.
Date: In yyyy-mm-dd format.
Local Time: In hh:mm:ss 24-hour format.
Solar Radiation: Measured in watts per meter^2.
Temperature: Measured in degrees Fahrenheit.
Humidity: Measured in percent.
Barometric Pressure: Measured in Hg.
Wind Direction: Measured in degrees.
Wind Speed: Measured in miles per hour.
Sunrise/Sunset: Recorded in Hawaii time.
Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to predict solar radiation using the provided meteorological data. By analyzing and processing this data, we aim to:

Extract and Select Relevant Features: Identify and select the most significant features that contribute to the prediction of solar radiation.
Model Development: Develop predictive models, including XGBoost and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), to forecast solar radiation.
Data Transformation and Preparation: Perform data wrangling, standardization, and feature engineering to improve model performance.
Steps and Methodology
1. Data Wrangling
Data Splitting: Split the date and time data into individual components such as month, day, year, seconds, and minutes.
Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features like Risehour, Setminute, etc.
Data Simplification: Drop unnecessary parent features to reduce dataset complexity.
Target Creation: Create the target dataset containing only the radiation column.
2. Feature Selection
Correlation Matrix: Identify correlations between features.
SelectKBest Method: Select the best features based on statistical tests.
Extra Tree Classifier: Use tree-based methods to select important features.
3. Feature Engineering
Data Transformation: Apply transformations like BoxCox, Log, MinMax, and Standardization to prepare the data for modeling.
Data Preparation: Perform standardization and split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Modeling
XGBoost: Use the XGBoost algorithm for initial predictions.
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP): Develop a neural network model to enhance prediction accuracy.
Conclusion
This project utilizes advanced data processing techniques and machine learning models to predict solar radiation, providing valuable insights for optimizing solar energy usage.
